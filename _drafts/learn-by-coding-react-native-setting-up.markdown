I am a fan of Angular. When it comes down to develop mobile applications, I always turn to the ionic framework for the benefit of leveraging my HTML and javascript knowledge. I heard the react framework from Facebook for quite awhile and I was turned off by JSX syntax until recently. I love the promise of virtual dom and immutable state. At the same time, there is a need to build a mobile application for code camp I am volunteering. So I decided to take the challenge to learn the react native and try to take notes during the process. This is the first one: setting up.

Preparing the dev environment for react-native is a relatively straightforward process by following the Facebook get started documentation at [here](/https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

Now I need a start point for the project. I could have used the 
```
  create-react-native-app
```
or
```
  react-native-cli
```
as Facebook includes in the documentation. However, my googling gave me another choice 
```
   ignite-cli
```
It is created by [InfiniteRead](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) and I like the example app they created for Chain React conference. There are many excellent react-native boilerplate tools. The Ignite is my choice for the job from my brief research.
