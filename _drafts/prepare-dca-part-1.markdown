One of my new year resolutions is to take a docker certified associate test in early 2019. I will be writing a series blogs as I prepare the test. This is the first part that gives my rationale behind this.

# What is DCA

>Docker Certifications validate technical knowledge with an industry-recognized credential. Our certifications recognize technical skills on the Docker platform.

# Why am I taking the test

I am teaching myself the docker for a whole and involving the docker community as a docker community leader for Mobile AL docker meetup for more than a year. I felt that I need to validate my knowledge of docker platform which will help me contribute to the community better.

# What is the blog series about

I am trying to organize the material I will use to prepare the test in the series so that it will not only help me for the test but hopefully help other potential test takers.
