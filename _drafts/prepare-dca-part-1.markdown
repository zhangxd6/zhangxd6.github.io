One of my new year resolutions is to take a docker certified associate test in early 2019. I will be writing a series blogs as I prepare the test. This is the first part that gives my rationale behind this.

# What is DCA

>Docker Certifications validate technical knowledge with an industry-recognized credential. Our certifications recognize technical skills on the Docker platform.
[docker site](https://success.docker.com/certification)

# Why am I taking the test

I am teaching myself the docker for a whole and involving the docker community as a docker community leader for Mobile AL docker meetup for more than a year. I felt that I need to validate my knowledge of docker platform which will help me contribute to the community better.

# What is the blog series about

I am trying to organize the material I will use to prepare the test in the series so that it will not only help me for the test but hopefully help other potential test takers.

# How am I going to go through the material

I will be using official documentation and [docker deep dive book](https://www.amazon.com/Docker-Deep-Dive-Nigel-Poulton-ebook/dp/B01LXWQUFF) together with [docker certified associate study guide](https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/docker%2F8fb020bf-fe21-409c-ba02-7e0fd18276d5_dca+study+guide+v1.0.pdf) and [Prepare Guide](https://github.com/DevOps-Academy-Org/dca-prep-guide) to cover all test domains.
