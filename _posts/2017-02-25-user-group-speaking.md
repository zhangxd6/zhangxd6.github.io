 A few days back, I gave my local user group presentation, 
 **[Get Started with Azure Service Fabric](http://lanug.net/Events/Getting-Started-with-Azure-Service-Fabric)**.  
 I really appreciate the Lower Alabama .Net User Group gave me this opportunity to speak. It was a great experience.
 Looking back what I could do better.

<!--more-->
* Arrive early. There was a tech problem that I was not able to connect my laptop to the projector. It was resolved by one of 
  friends got the cable.
* Timed practice. I ran out time and had to extend a couple more minutes to finish; a timed run before hand would give me a better idea.
* There was a lot content in this one hour presentation. It would be a good idea to remove some.
* Think twice about the live coding. Luckily I did not have a lot problems, however the ones I encountered did impact my delivery of content.
